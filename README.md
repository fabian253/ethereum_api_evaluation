# Ethereum API Evaluation

The project aims to evaluate the functionality of the associated [Ethereum API](https://github.com/fabian253/ethereum_api). Here, different areas are tested, which show the functionality as well as the possibilities and use cases of the API.

## Date Correctness

The first part of the evaluation addresses the correctness of the data, testing different endpoints and data. For the evaluation, the data of the developed Ethereum API is compared with the data of different API providers. These providers are the following three:

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)
- [Moralis](https://moralis.io)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io)
