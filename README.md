# Ethereum API Evaluation

The project aims to evaluate the functionality of the associated [Ethereum API](https://github.com/fabian253/ethereum_api). Here, different areas are tested, which show the functionality as well as the possibilities and use cases of the API.

## Data Correctness

The first part of the evaluation addresses the correctness of the data, testing different endpoints and data. For the evaluation, the data of the developed Ethereum API is compared with the data of different API providers. These providers are the following three:

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)
- [Moralis](https://moralis.io)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io)

Verifying the correctness of the data of the entire blockchain would be very extensive and resource-intensive, which is why various data samples are used instead. These samples are randomly generated and thus enable a random inspection. Samples can be found in the *evaluation/data_samples* folder.
Two areas are examined in the context of the correctness of the data. Firstly, the block data and secondly, the transaction data.
