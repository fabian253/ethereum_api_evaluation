# Ethereum API Evaluation

The project aims to evaluate the functionality of the associated [Ethereum API](https://github.com/fabian253/ethereum_api). Here, different areas are tested, which show the functionality as well as the possibilities and use cases of the API.

This evaluation is split into the following parts:

- Data Correctness
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Performance Evaluation
- Research Questions
  - How do tokens evolve over time and can a pattern be detected from this?
  - How do contracts implementing specific token standards evolve over time?
  - What transactions are processed for DAO tokens as part of their history and how does the token distribution evolve?

For the evaluation, several other API providers are used, including the following:

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)
- [Moralis](https://moralis.io)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io)
